										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Missing for more than a month in the dense Amazon rainforest, four Indigenous children have been found alive in southern Colombia, President Gustavo Petro announced Friday, praising a &#8220;joy for the whole country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are weak. Let&#8217;s let the doctors make their assessment,&#8221; Petro told the media in Bogota, after arriving back from a trip to Cuba.</p>
<p>The president earlier posted a photo on Twitter showing several adults, some dressed in military fatigues, attending to the children as they sat on tarps in the jungle. One rescuer held a bottle to the mouth of the smallest child, whom he held in his arms.</p>
<p>Originally from the Huitoto Indigenous group, the children &#8212; aged 13, nine, four and one &#8212; had been wandering alone in the jungle since 1 May, when the Cessna 206 in which they were traveling crashed.</p>
<p>The pilot had reported engine problems only minutes after taking off from a jungle area known as Araracuara on the 350-kilometer (220-mile) journey to the town of San Jose del Guaviare.</p>
<p>The bodies of the pilot, the children&#8217;s mother and a relative were all found at the crash site, where the plane sat almost vertical in the trees.</p>
<p>A massive search by 160 soldiers and 70 Indigenous people with intimate knowledge of the jungle had been under way ever since for the youngsters, garnering global attention.</p>
<p>The area is home to jaguars, snakes and other predators, as well as armed drug smuggling groups, but ongoing clues &#8212; footprints, a diaper, half-eaten fruit &#8212; led authorities to believe they were on the right track.</p>
<p>Worried that the children would continue wandering and become ever more difficult to locate, the air force dumped 10,000 flyers into the forest with instructions in Spanish and the children&#8217;s own Indigenous language, telling them to stay put.</p>
<p>The leaflets also included survival tips, and the military dropped food parcels and bottled water.</p>
<p>Rescuers had also been broadcasting a message recorded by the children&#8217;s grandmother, urging them not to move.</p>
<p>&#8216;A magical day&#8217;<br />
Huitoto children learn hunting, fishing and gathering and the kids&#8217; grandfather, Fidencio Valencia, had told AFP the children are well acquainted with the jungle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we have had a magical day,&#8221; Petro told the media upon his return from Cuba, where he signed a six-month truce with Colombia&#8217;s last active guerrilla group, the ELN.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting closer and attaining peace in the agreement that is moving forward with the ELN&#8230; And now I return and the first news is that indeed the Indigenous communities that were in the search and the military forces found the children 40 days later,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were alone, they made it on their own. An example of absolute survival that will go down in history,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Seventeen days after the children went missing, Petro announced that they had been found alive, but he retracted the statement a day later, saying he had been given false information.</p>
<p>On Friday, he praised &#8220;the effective coordination between the military and the Indigenous people&#8221; during the search, saying it was an &#8220;example of an alliance for the country to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valencia told AFP that the children had been found by a native of Araracuara who had been participating in the search.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need a flight or a helicopter to go and get them urgently,&#8221; the grandfather said.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Ivan Velasquez paid tribute to the various army units&#8217; &#8220;unshakeable and tireless&#8221; work, as well as to the Indigenous people who took part in the search.</p>
<p>Army rescuers &#8220;immediately took charge of and stabilized&#8221; the four siblings, who were to be transferred to San Jose del Guaviare, according to the minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow, depending on their medical assessment and condition, we hope they will be transferred to Bogota, to the military hospital,&#8221; Velasquez said.</p>
