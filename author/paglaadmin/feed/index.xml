										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Missing for more than a month in the dense Amazon rainforest, four Indigenous children have been found alive in southern Colombia, President Gustavo Petro announced Friday, praising a &#8220;joy for the whole country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are weak. Let&#8217;s let the doctors make their assessment,&#8221; Petro told the media in Bogota, after arriving back from a trip to Cuba.</p>
<p>The president earlier posted a photo on Twitter showing several adults, some dressed in military fatigues, attending to the children as they sat on tarps in the jungle. One rescuer held a bottle to the mouth of the smallest child, whom he held in his arms.</p>
<p>Originally from the Huitoto Indigenous group, the children &#8212; aged 13, nine, four and one &#8212; had been wandering alone in the jungle since 1 May, when the Cessna 206 in which they were traveling crashed.</p>
<p>The pilot had reported engine problems only minutes after taking off from a jungle area known as Araracuara on the 350-kilometer (220-mile) journey to the town of San Jose del Guaviare.</p>
<p>The bodies of the pilot, the children&#8217;s mother and a relative were all found at the crash site, where the plane sat almost vertical in the trees.</p>
<p>A massive search by 160 soldiers and 70 Indigenous people with intimate knowledge of the jungle had been under way ever since for the youngsters, garnering global attention.</p>
<p>The area is home to jaguars, snakes and other predators, as well as armed drug smuggling groups, but ongoing clues &#8212; footprints, a diaper, half-eaten fruit &#8212; led authorities to believe they were on the right track.</p>
<p>Worried that the children would continue wandering and become ever more difficult to locate, the air force dumped 10,000 flyers into the forest with instructions in Spanish and the children&#8217;s own Indigenous language, telling them to stay put.</p>
<p>The leaflets also included survival tips, and the military dropped food parcels and bottled water.</p>
<p>Rescuers had also been broadcasting a message recorded by the children&#8217;s grandmother, urging them not to move.</p>
<p>&#8216;A magical day&#8217;<br />
Huitoto children learn hunting, fishing and gathering and the kids&#8217; grandfather, Fidencio Valencia, had told AFP the children are well acquainted with the jungle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we have had a magical day,&#8221; Petro told the media upon his return from Cuba, where he signed a six-month truce with Colombia&#8217;s last active guerrilla group, the ELN.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting closer and attaining peace in the agreement that is moving forward with the ELN&#8230; And now I return and the first news is that indeed the Indigenous communities that were in the search and the military forces found the children 40 days later,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were alone, they made it on their own. An example of absolute survival that will go down in history,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Seventeen days after the children went missing, Petro announced that they had been found alive, but he retracted the statement a day later, saying he had been given false information.</p>
<p>On Friday, he praised &#8220;the effective coordination between the military and the Indigenous people&#8221; during the search, saying it was an &#8220;example of an alliance for the country to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valencia told AFP that the children had been found by a native of Araracuara who had been participating in the search.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need a flight or a helicopter to go and get them urgently,&#8221; the grandfather said.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Ivan Velasquez paid tribute to the various army units&#8217; &#8220;unshakeable and tireless&#8221; work, as well as to the Indigenous people who took part in the search.</p>
<p>Army rescuers &#8220;immediately took charge of and stabilized&#8221; the four siblings, who were to be transferred to San Jose del Guaviare, according to the minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow, depending on their medical assessment and condition, we hope they will be transferred to Bogota, to the military hospital,&#8221; Velasquez said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Erling Haaland says he is “not stressed” about his mini goal drought ahead of Saturday’s UEFA Champions League final against Inter Milan after already scoring 52 in his first season at Manchester City.</p>
<p>The Norwegian smashed the English Premier League record for goals in a single campaign, with 36, and has helped take City to within one game of a historic treble after also lifting the FA Cup.<br />
But a four-game scoreless streak is the longest of Haaland’s City career to date and he has netted just once in his past seven matches.</p>
<p>“You can think of it as one goal in seven games or 52 goals in 52 games and eight assists, I think (he has nine),” said Haaland. “You can think of it in both ways. I’m not stressed. I feel really good.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect to score this many goals but, again, I could have scored more. I’ve been missing a lot of chances, so I could have scored more. That’s the truth.”</p>
<p>City were already the dominant domestic force in English football before Haaland’s arrival from Borussia Dortmund last year.</p>
<p>However, the English champions are still to conquer Europe and his signing was seen as the final piece in the jigsaw to deliver Champions League glory.</p>
<p>“Of course I feel pressure. I would lie if I said I didn’t,” the 22-year-old said.</p>
<p>“You say it yourself and it’s true – they won the Premier League without me, they won every trophy without me.</p>
<p>“So I’m here to try to do a thing that the club has never done before and I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>City are huge favourites to get the better of the Italian giants in Istanbul and become just the second side to do the treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League in the same season.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola’s men became the first team to win the English domestic treble of Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup four years ago.</p>
<p>And Haaland believes it is little surprise that City are on the cusp of emulating the achievement of Manchester United, who won the treble in 1998/99.</p>
<p>“If you’d said this scenario before the season I wouldn’t think of it, of course,” said the Norwegian.</p>
<p>“But, again, when you look at the team, how close they’ve been with every single trophy every single season it’s not like it’s been not possible.</p>
<p>“We have been believing in ourselves ever since I came here. Just one game left.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After &#8216;The Crowded Room&#8217;, actor Tom Holland&#8217;s fans have to wait a little longer to see him next on the screen.</p>
<p>In an interview, Holland announced that he is taking the next year off from acting following the strenuous production of his new Apple TV+ crime thriller &#8216;The Crowded Room&#8217;, a media outlet reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a tough time, for sure,&#8221; Holland remarked about the show&#8217;s production.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were exploring certain emotions that I have definitely never experienced before. And then on top of that, being a producer, dealing with the day-to-day problems that come with any film set, just added that extra level of pressure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holland said he &#8220;loved the learning curve of becoming a producer,&#8221; but juggling two roles on one production while playing a character in a severe mental health state pushed him past his breaking point.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m no stranger to hard work,” Holland said.<br />
“I&#8217;ve lived by the idea that hard work is good work. Then again, the show did break me. There did come a time where I needed a break and disappeared and went to Mexico for a week and had time on a beach and laid low.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m now taking a year off, and that is a result of how difficult this show was. I am excited to see how it turns out. I feel like our hard work wasn&#8217;t in vain,” he continued.</p>
<p>Holland stars in &#8216;The Crowded Room&#8217; opposite Amanda Seyfried, Sasha Lane, Will Chase, Lior Raz, Laila Robins, Christopher Abbott and Henry Eikenberry.</p>
