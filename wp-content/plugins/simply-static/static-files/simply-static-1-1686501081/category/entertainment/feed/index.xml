										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After &#8216;The Crowded Room&#8217;, actor Tom Holland&#8217;s fans have to wait a little longer to see him next on the screen.</p>
<p>In an interview, Holland announced that he is taking the next year off from acting following the strenuous production of his new Apple TV+ crime thriller &#8216;The Crowded Room&#8217;, a media outlet reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a tough time, for sure,&#8221; Holland remarked about the show&#8217;s production.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were exploring certain emotions that I have definitely never experienced before. And then on top of that, being a producer, dealing with the day-to-day problems that come with any film set, just added that extra level of pressure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holland said he &#8220;loved the learning curve of becoming a producer,&#8221; but juggling two roles on one production while playing a character in a severe mental health state pushed him past his breaking point.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m no stranger to hard work,” Holland said.<br />
“I&#8217;ve lived by the idea that hard work is good work. Then again, the show did break me. There did come a time where I needed a break and disappeared and went to Mexico for a week and had time on a beach and laid low.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m now taking a year off, and that is a result of how difficult this show was. I am excited to see how it turns out. I feel like our hard work wasn&#8217;t in vain,” he continued.</p>
<p>Holland stars in &#8216;The Crowded Room&#8217; opposite Amanda Seyfried, Sasha Lane, Will Chase, Lior Raz, Laila Robins, Christopher Abbott and Henry Eikenberry.</p>
